## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run these programs, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. You can use GCC, which is available for most operating systems.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/CSC121-coursework.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```sh
    cd CSC121-coursework
    ```

## Compilation
To compile any of the C programs, use the following command:
```sh
gcc -o output_name source_file.c

# For example, to compile calculate-pi.c, you would use:

gcc -o calculate-pi calculate-pi.c
```

## Usage
To run the compiled program, use the following command:
```sh
./output_name

# For example, to run the compiled calculate-pi program, you would use:

./calculate-pi
```
